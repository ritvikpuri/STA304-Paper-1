# Toronto Apartment Evaluations

## Overview of Paper

This repository explores apartment building scores in the city of Toronto using data pulled from the City of Toronto Open Portal. The data can be viewed [here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/apartment-building-evaluation/). I ran data analysis over all the private properties in the city of Toronto and found out the factors that play an important part in increasing a buildings score. I also found the that there have been benefits to the buildings in the last 5 years since the program has been introduced. The final report can be found [here](https://github.com/ritvikpuri/Toronto-Apartment-Evaluations/blob/main/outputs/paper/paper.pdf)
